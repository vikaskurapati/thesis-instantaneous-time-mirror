abstract = {Abstract For Computational Aeroacoustics (CAA), good wave propagation properties are a crucial point for numerical schemes which solve the linearized Euler equations (LEE) in the time domain. A recently developed high order scheme with excellent wave propagation properties is the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method. The DG schemes are based on the Finite Element Method (FEM), using discontinuous piecewise polynomial basis functions to represent the solution. The efficiency can be highly improved for CAA applications if a quadrature-free formulation of the DG method is used, but nevertheless the DG schemes consume much computer storage due to the Runge-Kutta time integration procedure and the high number of degrees of freedom to be stored for each element. We managed to develop a high order single-step quadrature-free DG method which does not use a Runge-Kutta time integration procedure but which applies the ADER approach of Toro, Schwartzkopff et al. and where the accuracy of the scheme can further be improved using additionally a reconstruction technique working on the degrees of freedom of the element and its neighbors.},

abstract = {In this paper we apply the ADER approach to the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) framework for the two-dimensional linearized Euler equations. The result is an efficient high order accurate single-step scheme in time which uses less storage than Runge–Kutta DG schemes, especially for very high order of accuracy. The aim is to obtain an arbitrarily accurate scheme in space and time on unstructured grids for accurate noise propagation in the time domain in very complex geometries.

Résumé
Nous appliquons l'approche ADER au cadre des éléments finis discontinus pour les équations d'Euler linéarisées bidimensionnelles. Le résultat sont des schémas de haute précision tout en utilisant moins de mémoire que les schémas du type Runge–Kutta Galerkin discontinus, spécialement pour les ordres trés élevés. Le but est d'obtenir un schéma de précision arbitraire en temps et en espace sur des maillages non-structurés pour le calcul précis du bruit dans les géometries très complexes. Nous présentons des études de convergence numériques pour des méthodes ADER-DG sur des maillages structurés et non-structurés jusqu'à l'ordre 10 en temps et en espace. Pour citer cet article : M.

    abstract = "{We present a new numerical method to solve the heterogeneous elastic wave equations formulated as a linear hyperbolic system using first-order derivatives with arbitrary high-order accuracy in space and time on 3-D unstructured tetrahedral meshes. The method combines the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Finite Element (FE) method with the ADER approach using Arbitrary high-order DERivatives for flux calculation. In the DG framework, in contrast to classical FE methods, the numerical solution is approximated by piecewise polynomials which allow for discontinuities at element interfaces. Therefore, the well-established theory of numerical fluxes across element interfaces obtained by the solution of Riemann-Problems can be applied as in the finite volume framework. To define a suitable flux over the element surfaces, we solve so-called Generalized Riemann-Problems (GRP) at the element interfaces. The GRP solution provides simultaneously a numerical flux function as well as a time-integration method. The main idea is a Taylor expansion in time in which all time-derivatives are replaced by space derivatives using the so-called Cauchy–Kovalewski or Lax–Wendroff procedure which makes extensive use of the governing PDE. The numerical solution can thus be advanced for one time step without intermediate stages as typical, for example, for classical Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes. Due to the ADER time-integration technique, the same approximation order in space and time is achieved automatically. Furthermore, the projection of the tetrahedral elements in physical space on to a canonical reference tetrahedron allows for an efficient implementation, as many computations of 3-D integrals can be carried out analytically beforehand. Based on a numerical convergence analysis, we demonstrate that the new schemes provide very high order accuracy even on unstructured tetrahedral meshes and computational cost and storage space for a desired accuracy can be reduced by higher-order schemes. Moreover, due to the choice of the basis functions for the piecewise polynomial approximation, the new ADER–DG method shows spectral convergence on tetrahedral meshes. An application of the new method to a well-acknowledged test case and comparisons with analytical and reference solutions, obtained by different well-established methods, confirm the performance of the proposed method. Therefore, the development of the highly accurate ADER–DG approach for tetrahedral meshes provides a numerical technique to approach 3-D wave propagation problems in complex geometry with unforeseen accuracy.}",

    abstract = "{We present a new numerical approach to solve the elastic wave equation in heterogeneous media in the presence of externally given source terms with arbitrary high-order accuracy in space and time on unstructured triangular meshes. We combine a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with the ideas of the ADER time integration approach using Arbitrary high-order DERivatives. The time integration is performed via the so-called Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure using repeatedly the governing partial differential equation itself. In contrast to classical finite element methods we allow for discontinuities of the piecewise polynomial approximation of the solution at element interfaces. This way, we can use the well-established theory of fluxes across element interfaces based on the solution of Riemann problems as developed in the finite volume framework. In particular, we replace time derivatives in the Taylor expansion of the time integration procedure by space derivatives to obtain a numerical scheme of the same high order in space and time using only one single explicit step to evolve the solution from one time level to another. The method is specially suited for linear hyperbolic systems such as the heterogeneous elastic wave equations and allows an efficient implementation. We consider continuous sources in space and time and point sources characterized by a Delta distribution in space and some continuous source time function. Hereby, the method is able to deal with point sources at any position in the computational domain that does not necessarily need to coincide with a mesh point. Interpolation is automatically performed by evaluation of test functions at the source locations. The convergence analysis demonstrates that very high accuracy is retained even on strongly irregular meshes and by increasing the order of the ADER–DG schemes computational time and storage space can be reduced remarkably. Applications of the proposed method to Lamb's Problem, a problem of strong material heterogeneities and to an example of global seismic wave propagation finally confirm its accuracy, robustness and high flexibility.}",

Because time and space play similar roles in wave propagation, manipulating time boundaries provides a complementary approach. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the relevance of this concept by introducing instantaneous time mirrors. We show with water waves that a sudden change of the effective gravity generates time-reversed waves that refocus at the source. We generalize this concept for all kinds of waves, introducing a universal framework which explains the effect of any time disruption on wave propagation. We show that sudden changes of the medium properties generate instant wave sources that emerge instantaneously from the entire space at the time disruption. The time-reversed waves originate from these ‘Cauchy sources’, which are the counterpart of Huygens virtual sources on a time boundary. It allows us to revisit the holographic method and introduce a new approach for wave control.}",

abstract="We present important extensions of the software SeisSol based on the arbitrary high-order Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Finite-Element method to model seismic wave propagation using non-conforming hybrid meshes for model discretization and to account for highly heterogeneous material. In these new approaches we include a point-wise integration of numerical fluxes across element interfaces for the non-conforming boundaries preserving numerical accuracy while avoiding numerical artifacts due to the mesh coupling. We apply the proposed scheme to a scenario test case of the Grenoble valley to demonstrate the methods capability. Furthermore, we present the extension to space-variable coefficients to describe material variations inside each element using the same numerical approximation strategy as for the velocity-stress variables in the formulation of the wave equation. The combination of the DG method with a time integration scheme based on the solution of Arbitrary accuracy DErivatives Riemann problems (ADER) still provides an explicit, one-step scheme which achieves arbitrary high-order accuracy in space and time. We confirm the accuracy of the proposed scheme a numerical experiments considering randomly heterogeneous material and compare our results to independent reference solutions. Finally, we apply the scheme to an earthquake scenario considering the effect of a sedimentary basin and compare the efficiency of the classical global time stepping technique and the local time stepping for different partitioning strategies and show results for a strong scaling test.",

The schemes may thus be viewed as Godunov methods of very high order of accuracy. We present the ADER formulation for the linear advection equation with constant coefficients, in one and multiple space dimensions.
