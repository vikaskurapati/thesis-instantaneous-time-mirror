abstract = {Abstract For Computational Aeroacoustics (CAA), good wave propagation properties are a crucial point for numerical schemes which solve the linearized Euler equations (LEE) in the time domain. A recently developed high order scheme with excellent wave propagation properties is the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method. The DG schemes are based on the Finite Element Method (FEM), using discontinuous piecewise polynomial basis functions to represent the solution. The efficiency can be highly improved for CAA applications if a quadrature-free formulation of the DG method is used, but nevertheless the DG schemes consume much computer storage due to the Runge-Kutta time integration procedure and the high number of degrees of freedom to be stored for each element. We managed to develop a high order single-step quadrature-free DG method which does not use a Runge-Kutta time integration procedure but which applies the ADER approach of Toro, Schwartzkopff et al. and where the accuracy of the scheme can further be improved using additionally a reconstruction technique working on the degrees of freedom of the element and its neighbors.},

abstract = {In this paper we apply the ADER approach to the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) framework for the two-dimensional linearized Euler equations. The result is an efficient high order accurate single-step scheme in time which uses less storage than Runge–Kutta DG schemes, especially for very high order of accuracy. The aim is to obtain an arbitrarily accurate scheme in space and time on unstructured grids for accurate noise propagation in the time domain in very complex geometries.

Résumé
Nous appliquons l'approche ADER au cadre des éléments finis discontinus pour les équations d'Euler linéarisées bidimensionnelles. Le résultat sont des schémas de haute précision tout en utilisant moins de mémoire que les schémas du type Runge–Kutta Galerkin discontinus, spécialement pour les ordres trés élevés. Le but est d'obtenir un schéma de précision arbitraire en temps et en espace sur des maillages non-structurés pour le calcul précis du bruit dans les géometries très complexes. Nous présentons des études de convergence numériques pour des méthodes ADER-DG sur des maillages structurés et non-structurés jusqu'à l'ordre 10 en temps et en espace. Pour citer cet article : M.

    abstract = "{We present a new numerical method to solve the heterogeneous elastic wave equations formulated as a linear hyperbolic system using first-order derivatives with arbitrary high-order accuracy in space and time on 3-D unstructured tetrahedral meshes. The method combines the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Finite Element (FE) method with the ADER approach using Arbitrary high-order DERivatives for flux calculation. In the DG framework, in contrast to classical FE methods, the numerical solution is approximated by piecewise polynomials which allow for discontinuities at element interfaces. Therefore, the well-established theory of numerical fluxes across element interfaces obtained by the solution of Riemann-Problems can be applied as in the finite volume framework. To define a suitable flux over the element surfaces, we solve so-called Generalized Riemann-Problems (GRP) at the element interfaces. The GRP solution provides simultaneously a numerical flux function as well as a time-integration method. The main idea is a Taylor expansion in time in which all time-derivatives are replaced by space derivatives using the so-called Cauchy–Kovalewski or Lax–Wendroff procedure which makes extensive use of the governing PDE. The numerical solution can thus be advanced for one time step without intermediate stages as typical, for example, for classical Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes. Due to the ADER time-integration technique, the same approximation order in space and time is achieved automatically. Furthermore, the projection of the tetrahedral elements in physical space on to a canonical reference tetrahedron allows for an efficient implementation, as many computations of 3-D integrals can be carried out analytically beforehand. Based on a numerical convergence analysis, we demonstrate that the new schemes provide very high order accuracy even on unstructured tetrahedral meshes and computational cost and storage space for a desired accuracy can be reduced by higher-order schemes. Moreover, due to the choice of the basis functions for the piecewise polynomial approximation, the new ADER–DG method shows spectral convergence on tetrahedral meshes. An application of the new method to a well-acknowledged test case and comparisons with analytical and reference solutions, obtained by different well-established methods, confirm the performance of the proposed method. Therefore, the development of the highly accurate ADER–DG approach for tetrahedral meshes provides a numerical technique to approach 3-D wave propagation problems in complex geometry with unforeseen accuracy.}",

    abstract = "{We present a new numerical approach to solve the elastic wave equation in heterogeneous media in the presence of externally given source terms with arbitrary high-order accuracy in space and time on unstructured triangular meshes. We combine a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with the ideas of the ADER time integration approach using Arbitrary high-order DERivatives. The time integration is performed via the so-called Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure using repeatedly the governing partial differential equation itself. In contrast to classical finite element methods we allow for discontinuities of the piecewise polynomial approximation of the solution at element interfaces. This way, we can use the well-established theory of fluxes across element interfaces based on the solution of Riemann problems as developed in the finite volume framework. In particular, we replace time derivatives in the Taylor expansion of the time integration procedure by space derivatives to obtain a numerical scheme of the same high order in space and time using only one single explicit step to evolve the solution from one time level to another. The method is specially suited for linear hyperbolic systems such as the heterogeneous elastic wave equations and allows an efficient implementation. We consider continuous sources in space and time and point sources characterized by a Delta distribution in space and some continuous source time function. Hereby, the method is able to deal with point sources at any position in the computational domain that does not necessarily need to coincide with a mesh point. Interpolation is automatically performed by evaluation of test functions at the source locations. The convergence analysis demonstrates that very high accuracy is retained even on strongly irregular meshes and by increasing the order of the ADER–DG schemes computational time and storage space can be reduced remarkably. Applications of the proposed method to Lamb's Problem, a problem of strong material heterogeneities and to an example of global seismic wave propagation finally confirm its accuracy, robustness and high flexibility.}",

Because time and space play similar roles in wave propagation, manipulating time boundaries provides a complementary approach. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the relevance of this concept by introducing instantaneous time mirrors. We show with water waves that a sudden change of the effective gravity generates time-reversed waves that refocus at the source. We generalize this concept for all kinds of waves, introducing a universal framework which explains the effect of any time disruption on wave propagation. We show that sudden changes of the medium properties generate instant wave sources that emerge instantaneously from the entire space at the time disruption. The time-reversed waves originate from these ‘Cauchy sources’, which are the counterpart of Huygens virtual sources on a time boundary.

In these new approaches we include a point-wise integration of numerical fluxes across element interfaces for the non-conforming boundaries preserving numerical accuracy while avoiding numerical artifacts due to the mesh coupling. We apply the proposed scheme to a scenario test case of the Grenoble valley to demonstrate the methods capability. Furthermore, we present the extension to space-variable coefficients to describe material variations inside each element using the same numerical approximation strategy as for the velocity-stress variables in the formulation of the wave equation. The combination of the DG method with a time integration scheme based on the solution of Arbitrary accuracy DErivatives Riemann problems (ADER) still provides an explicit, one-step scheme which achieves arbitrary high-order accuracy in space and time. We confirm the accuracy of the proposed scheme a numerical experiments considering randomly heterogeneous material and compare our results to independent reference solutions. Finally, we apply the scheme to an earthquake scenario considering the effect of a sedimentary basin and compare the efficiency of the classical global time stepping technique and the local time stepping for different partitioning strategies and show results for a strong scaling test.",

The wide range of scales encountered lead to the problem that the fastest cell of the simulation dictates the global time step. Multirate time integration methods can be employed to alter the time step locally so that slower components take longer and fewer time steps, resulting in a moderate to substantial reduction of the computational cost, depending on the scenario to simulate [S. Osher, R. Sanders, Numerical approximations to nonlinear conservation laws with locally varying time and space grids, Math. Comput. 41 (1983) 321–336; H. Tang, G. Warnecke, A class of high resolution schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws and convection-diffusion equations with varying time and pace grids, SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 26 (4) (2005) 1415–1431; E. Constantinescu, A. Sandu, Multirate timestepping methods for hyperbolic conservation laws, SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 33 (3) (2007) 239–278]. In air pollution modeling the advection part is usually integrated explicitly in time, where the time step is constrained by a locally varying Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) number. Multirate schemes are a useful tool to decouple different physical regions so that this constraint becomes a local instead of a global restriction. Therefore it is of major interest to apply multirate schemes to the advection equation. We introduce a generic recursive multirate Runge–Kutta scheme that can be easily adapted to an arbitrary number of refinement levels. It preserves the linear invariants of the system and is of third order accuracy when applied to certain explicit Runge–Kutta methods as base method.}

While the main contention of the two paradoxes is correct, that the H theorem is inconsistent with classical dynamical laws, the arguments there can be considerably simplified and the “paradoxes” answered more directly. If the distribution function f(qK,pK,t) is governed by an equation which is time-reversal invariant (such as the Liouville equation for a closed dynamical system), then it can be shown immediately that dH/dt=0, H=cons. In this case, both paradoxes disappear, but together with them, the dH/dt<0 part of the H theorem also has disappeared, i.e., there is no second law of thermodynamics. If f(qK,pK,t) is governed by an equation which is not time-reversal invariant (such as the Boltzmann equation, or the Master Equation for Markovian processes), then (1) there is no argument for f and H(t) to retrace their sequence of values upon the reversal of all the velocities of the system, (2) there is no quasiperiod in which f and H(t) return to their earlier values. In this case, both paradoxes disappear also, but then one must go beyond classical dynamics in order to maintain the H theorem.}",

  abstract = "{The reversibility, or Loschmidt paradox, is a thought experiment in which microscopic reversibility is exploited to generate an apparently spontaneous trajectory in which entropy decreases, thus violating the Second Law of Thermodynamics (SLT). To achieve this, the system is allowed to evolve from a low-entropy to a high-entropy configuration, at which point all velocities of its molecules are reversed, thus producing the desired effect. In this paper we focus on the velocity reversal step. Implementing this step requires the measurement of velocities and positions, which must be stored in a memory. Even in the case of a reversible measurement, the erasure of the stored information, necessary to reset the measuring device to its original state, has an entropy cost that offsets the entropy decrease during the reverse evolution of the system. This cost is sufficient to explain why the described procedure does not violate the SLT.}",

    abstract = "{We present a new method for near-source ground-motion calculations  due to earthquake rupture on potentially geometrically complex faults. Following the  recently introduced Discontinuous Galerkin approach with local time stepping on  tetrahedral meshes, we use piecewise polynomial approximations of the unknown  variables inside each element and achieve the same approximation order in time and  space due to the new ader time integration scheme that uses Arbitrary high-order  DERivatives. We show how an external source term and its heterogeneous properties  in space and time, given by a fine discretization of an extended rupture surface, can  be included in much coarser tetrahedral meshes due to the subcell resolution of the  high-order polynomial representation. Hereby, the rupture surface is represented very  generally as a point cloud of the center locations of individual subfaults at which  each polynomial test function is evaluated exactly inside an element and the space– time integration of the source term is accurately computed at each timestep. Besides  the incorporation of complex source kinematics we also present the effects of model  boundaries that can degrade the accuracy of seismograms due to weak artificial reflections.  We propose an extended computational domain of a coarsely meshed buffer  region and show that our scheme using the local timestepping completely avoids  such boundary problems with only slightly increasing the computational cost. We  validate the new approach against different test cases, comparing our results with  analytic, quasianalytic, and a series of reference solutions. Our work shows that  adding the functionality of accurately treating finite source-rupture models into the  general framework of the ader-Discontinuous Galerkin approach is an important  contribution to modeling realistic earthquake scenarios, allowing the efficient inclusion  of heterogeneous source kinematics and complex rupture-surface geometries in  near-source ground-motion simulations.}",
