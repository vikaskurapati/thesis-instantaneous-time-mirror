%TODO: Acknowledgments
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Michael Bader and my advisor, MSc. Lukas Krenz 
for their invaluable guidance, support, and encouragement throughout my research. 
Their vast knowledge, constructive criticism, and prompt feedback helped shape my ideas and made this thesis possible. \\

I would also like to thank the faculty members of the Chair of Scientific Computing for their continuous support and for providing 
me with a challenging yet rewarding academic experience. Their passion and dedication to teaching and research have been a 
great source of inspiration to me. \\

I am indebted to my family and friends for their unwavering support, encouragement, and patience during this challenging 
journey. Their love and faith in me have been my constant motivation. \\
