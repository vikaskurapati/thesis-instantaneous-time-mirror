%TODO: Acknowledgments
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Michael Bader and my advisor, Lukas Krenz 
for their invaluable guidance, support, and encouragement throughout my master's thesis. 
Their vast knowledge, constructive criticism, and prompt feedback helped shape my ideas and made this thesis possible. \\

I would like to thank Prof. Gregor Hillers for funding my travel to Helsinki, Finland to collaborate with the team at University of Helsinki
to work and get more ideas to work on my thesis. I would also like to thank Prof. Alice Gabriel for being involved in the project and providing us valuable inputs.
The discussions have helped me get ideas on how to go about the thesis and the project in general.\\

I would also like to thank the faculty members of the Chair of Scientific Computing for their continuous support and for providing 
me with a challenging yet rewarding academic experience. Their passion and dedication to teaching and research have been a 
great source of inspiration to me. \\

I am indebted to my family and friends for their unwavering support, encouragement, and patience during this challenging 
journey. Their love and faith in me have been my constant motivation. \\
