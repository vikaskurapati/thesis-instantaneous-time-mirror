%TODO: Abstract
This thesis presents a numerical investigation of the wave reversal technique using the Instantaneous 
Time Mirror method in the simulation software SeiSSol (\href{https://seissol.org/}{https://seissol.org/}). The focus of 
the study is to develop a novel approach to accurately determine the source of an earthquake by analyzing the time evolution 
of the seismic waves in both the forward and time-reversed directions..Finally, the method was applied to the benchmark test, 
demonstrating the ability of the technique to retrace the source of a Seissmic wave.
