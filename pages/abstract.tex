%TODO: Abstract
This thesis presents a numerical investigation of the wave reversal technique using the Instantaneous 
Time Mirror method in the simulation software \href{https://seissol.org/}{SeisSol}. Earthquakes produce two different kinds of waves i.e., P- and S-waves. 
The focus of the study is to develop a novel approach to accurately determine the source of an earthquake by analyzing the time evolution 
of the seismic waves in both the forward and time-reversed directions. We analyze the application of an \acf{ITM} on a planar traveling wave and spherical waves
produced by point sources. We then refocus each of the P- and S-waves separately to the source location. We demonstrate the application
of the \ac{ITM} on different types of point sources and show that the \ac{ITM} is able to refocus the waves to the source location.
