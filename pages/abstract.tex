%TODO: Abstract
This thesis presents a numerical investigation of the wave reversal technique using the Instantaneous 
Time Mirror method in the simulation software \href{https://seissol.org/}{SeisSol}. Earthquakes produce two different kinds of waves i.e., P- and S- waves. 
The focus of the study is to develop a novel approach to accurately determine the source of an earthquake by analyzing the time evolution 
of the seismic waves in both the forward and time-reversed directions. We analyse the application of a Time-Mirror on a planar travelling wave and spherical waves
produced by point sources. The method was then applied to the benchmark test, demonstrating the ability of the technique to retrace the source of a Seissmic wave. Finally, we refocus
each of the P- and S- waves separately to refocus the waves to the source location.
